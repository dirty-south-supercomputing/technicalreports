# Dirty South Supercomputing Technical Reports

Imagining ourselves to be some kinds of academic or who knows what, we at DSSCAW
endeavor to produce quality writeups of various projects with which we are involved.
Papers are only released if permission is given by our clients, but they are not
allowed editorial control.

The Makefile generates one PDF per paper. I'm most recently using
[XƎTEX](https://tug.org/xetex/) 3.14159265 and
[Biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/) 2.12. Most images
have had some degree of processing through the [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) 2.x.
