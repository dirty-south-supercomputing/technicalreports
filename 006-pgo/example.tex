\chapter{A worked example of team selection\label{chap:example}}

Let's consider the Fossil Cup of summer 2025, which began and ended while I was writing this book.
Like the Great League, the Fossil Cup had a CP1500 bound, and further
  restricted participants to those with Rock, Steel, or Water in their typings.
This limits teams to 51 of the 171 typings (29.8\%): the three monotypes, seventeen dualtypes
 involving Rock, sixteen dualtypes involving Steel (we already counted Rock+Steel), and
 fifteen dualtypes involving Water (we already counted Rock+Water and Steel+Water).
Consulting \autoref{table:defenders}, we see these 51 typings populated by 267 total Pokémon.
The biggest typing by far is pure Water, with 66.
Four typings are unpopulated: Fire+Water, Normal+Steel, Normal+Rock, and Ghost+Rock.
One hundred matches in, I was doing alright (despite far from optimal IVs)
  with the following team, assembled largely off vibes:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{llrrrr}
    Pokémon & IV@Level & $\mathit{Eff_A}$ & $\mathit{Eff_D}$ & MHP & $\sqrt[3]{BP}$\\
    \Midrule
    Greninja & \ivlev{15}{14}{12}{20} & 142.18 & 99.17 & 112 & 115.27 \\
    Magcargo & \ivlev{15}{13}{12}{32.5} & 115.01 & 152.35 & 111 & 124.82 \\
    Gastrodon & \ivlev{0}{3}{15}{25.5} & 114.01 & 98.49 & 174 & 125.01 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
With attacks (Power+Energy@Turns and Power@Energy in parens):
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{llp{.35\textwidth}}
    Pokémon & Fast attack & Charged attack(s)\\
    \Midrule
    Greninja & Water Shuriken (7.2+14@3) & Hydro Cannon (100@40),\newline Night Slash (50@35)\\
    Magcargo & Incinerate (24+20@5) & Overheat (156@55),\newline Stone Edge (100@55)\\
    Gastrodon & Mud-Slap (14.4+10@3) & Earth Power (108@55)\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
I was having particular trouble with teams making use of Jellicent, Quagsire,
  Jumpluff, Lucario, Samuratt, and Poliwrath, all members of the ``meta'' (elite Cup participants
  as judged by the community).
How could I improve?

First off, I could ditch that Night Slash, useful against basically no one even with STAB,
  and replace it with Aerial Ace.
This gives Greninja something of merit against Jumpluff---it eats five more energy
  (40 vs. 35) than Night Slash, but brings 88 power rather than 60.
That one-in-eight chance for a 50\% boost to attack seemed unlikely to be missed.
Gastrodon doesn't have many great choices for a second move.
I hardly needed more Water strength, so I threw on Body Slam for opponents strong
  against Ground.

\section{Boosting the numbers}
Without changing my choice of species, the following configurations are desirable
  in the context of optimizing for $\sqrt[3]{BP}$\footnote{If we optimized for $\frac{BS}{3}$,
   as done in \autoref{chap:optimal}, we'd see different ideals.}:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llrrrr}
  Pokémon & IV@Level & $\mathit{Eff_A}$ & $\mathit{Eff_D}$ & MHP & $\sqrt[3]{BP}$\\
  \Midrule
  Greninja &\ivlev{3}{15}{12}{20} & 138.35 & 102.23 & 115 & 117.60\\
  Magcargo &\ivlev{0}{15}{14}{38.5} & 108.67 & 161.05 & 118 & 127.34\\
  Gastrodon &\ivlev{1}{15}{14}{24.5} & 112.41 & 104.47 & 170 & 125.92\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Of course, it is not generally possible to change IVs.
Even if I could, the benefits would be meager: a 2.02\% increase for Greninja,
  2.02\% to Magcargo, and a mere 0.73\% for Gastrodon, all of it coming
  in defense and HP at the expense of a bit of attack.
The means themselves are unspectacular, but not bad: Gastrodon and Magcargo are up there
  in the thick of things, and Greninja is blasting away with that Hydro Cannon every nine turns.

\section{Covering the typings}
Remember what I said earlier: it is better to be effective against a type than for that
  type to be ineffective against you.
We want to maximize the number of relevant typings against which we are effective or
  very effective, and minimize the number of types which are effective or very effective against us.
Only as a secondary consideration need we minimize the number of relevant
  typings against which we are ineffective, and maximize the number of types
  which are ineffective against us.
Ideally we want to \textit{systematically force} an effective attack from each
  of our Pokémon against all possible typings.

As noted in \autoref{sec:typeleagues}, there exist two minimal coverings of the forty-seven
  remaining typings, each of size six:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c}
 Bug, Fairy, Fire, Grass, Ground, Rock\\
 Bug, Dragon, Fire, Grass, Ground, Rock\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Bug isn't known for high PPT\@. Infestation manages two while achieving four EPT,
 but requires three turns. Bug Bite does three on both in a single turn.

Grass and Ground make up a cover of the core types, as do Fighting and Grass.
All three of these types (and only these three types) are strong against two of the three
  types making up the population.
Fighting and Ground are standard against the third type (Water), while Grass is ineffective
  against its third type (Steel).
Due to the huge number of potential participants with Water in their typing, we pretty
  much need Grass.

It is impossible to cover Grass's ineffectiveness against Steel with either Fighting or Ground,
  due dualtypes of Steel with any of Fighting or Ground's many weaknesses.
Similarly, Grass's strength against Rock and Water can be undone by dualtyping them with a Grass weakness.
We need something strong where Grass is weak.
Something like Rock.
Rock is ineffective against Steel, but standard against our other two cores.
Meanwhile, it's strong against three of Grass's weaknesses outside the core (Bug, Fire, and Flying),
  leaving only Water+Poison, Water+Grass, Water+Dragon, Rock+Poison, Rock+Grass, and Rock+Dragon
  as standard.
We're ineffective against anything with Steel except for Steel+Ground, Steel+Rock, and Steel+Water, which
  Grass can hit for standard damage.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{lp{.7\linewidth}}
Poison+Water & Tentacool, Tenracruel, Qwilfish, Mareanie, Toxapex, Skrelp\\
Grass+Water & Lombre, Lotad, Ludicolo\\
Dragon+Water & Kingdra, Palkia, Origin Form Palkia\\
Poison+Rock & Nihilego\\
Grass+Rock & Lileep, Cradily\\
Dragon+Rock & Tyrunt, Tyrantrum\\
Steel & Galarian Meowth, Registeel, Klink, Klang, Klinklang, Meltan, Melmetal, Perrserker\\
Steel+Dragon & Dialga, Origin Forme Dialga\\
Steel+Electric & Magnemite, Magneton, Magnezone, Togedemaru \\
Steel+Fairy & Mawile, Klefki\\
Steel+Flying & Skarmory, Celesteela \\
Steel+Ghost & Honedge, Doublade, Aegislash (Blade), Aegislash (Shield), Gholdengo\\
Steel+Poison & Varoom, Revavroom\\
Steel+Fire & Heatran\\
Steel+Bug & Forretress, Scizor, Trash Wormadam, Escavalier, Durant, Genesect\\
Steel+Fighting & Lucario, Crowned Shield Zamazenta\\
Steel+Dark & Pawniard, Bisharp, Kingambit\\
Steel+Grass & Ferroseed, Ferrothorn, Kartana\\
Steel+Psychic & Beldum, Metang, Metagross, Jirachi, Bronzong, Bronzor\\
Steel+Ice & Alolan Sandshrew, Alolan Sandslash\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

If our three Pokémon all have one Grass and one Rock charged attack,
  all three of them have a charged attack strong against all but
  71 of 267 potential opponents (73.4\%).
Typings with Grass or Rock in them will get STAB on one of the two attacks.
We do no better than standard against 17 (6.4\%), and both attacks are
  ineffective against 54 (20.2\%), among them most of anything involving
  Steel.
Rock gets us into the tournament, while Grass would have to pair with Steel,
  Rock, or Water.
Rock opens up weaknesses to Fighting, Grass, Ground, Steel, and Water.

\subsection{Eliminating common weaknesses\label{subsec:eliminatingweak}}
I wasn't mowing the grass; Grass was mowing me down.
Two of my Pokémon were weak against it, Gastrodon doubly so.
Magcargo could handle Grass (especially Steel+Grass Ferrothorn), but
 without switch advantage, there was usually a Water Pokémon to come
 in and put out its fire.
Looking at the three Pokémon, there are no Grass attacks to learn.
Despite that awesome 4.67 EPT from Water Shuriken, Greninja was probably
  the weakest link due to its lack of bulk.
If it goes in with shield disadvantage, it has a bad time.
No other fast attack achieves 4.67, but we get 4.5 from several---Psycho
  Cut, Fairy Wind, Poison Sting, Thunder Shock, and Karate Chop,
  all of which are fewer turns than Shuriken's 3.
Karate Chop (2.5) and Hex or Rollout (2.33) even beat its PPT of 2.
The first two don't seem available from any useful Pokémon, but
  Rollout is available from Blastoise, and we'd even be able to
  keep Hydro Cannon!
Unfortunately, there are no Grass attacks on Blastoise, though
  he does offer Skull Bash, a powerful Normal attack that
  will do at least standard damage to just about everyone.
Big beefy Clodsire drives big energy with Mud Shot, and can handle
  Grass with a Poison charged attack, bringing along Stone Edge
  or Earthquake for Fire coverage and the potential for massive hits.
It can furthermore easily gain shield advantage.
Replacing Greninja with Clodsire boosted my Elo by about two hundred points
 over the course of forty games, but I missed my froggy buddy.
