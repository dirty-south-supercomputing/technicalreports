\chapter{Trainers}
A Pokémon GO account is synonymous with its associated Trainer.

\section{Levels}
\label{sec:levels}
New Trainers start at Level 1 (of 50) with 0 XP\@.
A new Level is conferred as soon as the Trainer's XP meets or exceeds
  that Level's XP threshold (\autoref{table:xp40}).
It is possible to advance multiple Levels via a single award of XP\@.

Certain elements of gameplay are gated by Trainer Level (\autoref{table:levelgates}),
  and a Trainer cannot control Pokémon whose Level exceeds the Trainer's
  by more than 10---a Level 22 Trainer will be unable to power up (\autoref{sec:plevel}) a Pokémon past Level 32.
Reaching a new Level is rewarded with items (\autoref{table:levelitems}).
Levels 7, 8, 15, and 20 introduce Special Research (\autoref{sec:research}).

\caption{Items awarded for reaching Trainer Levels}
\label{table:levelitems}
\end{center}
\end{table}

All level-gated mechanics, including the ability to fully power up Pokémon,
 are available upon reaching Level 40\footnote{The maximum Pokémon Level is 50 (\autoref{chap:pokemon}).}.
Levels 43, 45, 48, and 50 provide extra Challenge quests.
Levels 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, and 50 open some cosmetic options for Trainer avatars.
Finally, Trainer Level determines the maximum level of wild spawns
  (\autoref{sec:spawns}) and the difficulty of Team GO Rocket
  opponents (\autoref{sec:rocket}).

\section{Team}
Upon reaching Level 5, a Trainer can join one of three Teams: Mystic (blue),
  Valor (red), or Instinct (yellow).
The only non-cosmetic effect of Team choice regards Gyms (\autoref{sec:gyms}), which
  are held by one Team at a time.
A Trainer can change their Team by purchasing and making use of a Team Medallion.
The cost is 1,000 Pokécoins, and 365 days must pass between Medallion purchases.

It seems sadly impossible to join GO Rocket. Alas!

\section{Capacities}
A Trainer enters this world with no Pokémon, no Pokécoins, no Stardust,
  no Max Particles, no Candy of any kind, no Mega Energy of any kind,
  no Primal Energy of any kind, no Fusion Energy of any kind, and no Crown
  Energy of any kind.
They have initial carrying capacity sufficient for 300 Pokémon.
Additional storage can be added in increments of 50, up to a total of 10,500.
Each upgrade costs 200 Pokécoins.
A full upgrade will thus currently run you 40,800 Pokécoins.

The Trainer has a Bag capable of storing 350 items (strangely, not all items
  count against this limit, including Gifts, Stickers, and the Postcard Book,
  which I suppose are shoved down the front of one's Trainer uniform).
The Bag comes with an Infinite Incubator, a Camera, 2 Incense, and 50 Poké Balls,
  and thus space for 296 new items.
The Bag can be upgraded to store up to 8,800 items.
Here again, each upgrade costs 200 Pokécoins, and increases capacity by 50 items.
The maximum Bag is thus 33,800 Pokécoins.

The Trainer has a Postcard Book with seven pages, each capable of retaining
 50 Postcards, for an inital limit of 350.
Pages can be added for 100 Pokécoins each, up to a maximum of 40 Pages
 supporting 2,000 total Postcards.
Such a monster will cost 3,300 Pokécoins.

The Trainer can carry up to twenty Gifts at a time. and up to 25 of each sticker.
To date, no one has found any use for the stickers.

Upon obtaining four Shadow Shards, they are automatically refined into a Purified Gem.
The Trainer can carry up to ten Purified Gems.
Shadow Shards cannot be collected while holding ten gems.

The Trainer can accumulate no more than 9,999 units of a given Mega Energy,
 Primal Energy, or Fusion Energy.
A limit on Crown Energy is not yet known, but seems likely to be 9,999.

No limit is known for Candy nor Candy XL.
A lower bound has been established in the millions.
It seems plausible that the limit is one less than a large power of 2:
  2,147,483,647 seems as good a guess as any\footnote{If the limit is driven by UI requirements, it's likely lower.}.

\section{Pokédexen}
\label{sec:dexen}
The Trainer has ten Pokédexen\footnote{``Pokédexes'' to the uncultured.}:
  ``Pokémon'', ``Shiny'', ``XXL'', ``XXS'', ``G-Max'', ``Mega'', ``Shadow'',
  ``Purified'', ``🟉100\%'', and ``Lucky''.
All ten start empty, and several start locked.
\textbf{FIXME details}
Entries are filled in as the relevant Pokémon are acquired (via any means).
Once registered, Pokédex entries are never unregistered.
If an entry is made in some Pokédex, the corresponding entry is also made
  in the primary Pokédex.
Shiny Shadow Pokémon and Shiny Purified Pokémon are registered to the
  ``Shiny'' Pokédex along with the ``Shadow'' or ``Purified'' Pokédex.

Besides pointless nostalgia, the ``Info'' and ``Battle'' tabs of filled entries
  provide information regarding evolution (\autoref{sec:evolution}), type
  relations (\autoref{chap:types}), and attacks (\autoref{chap:attacks}).
Trainers can place an alert on one filled or silhouetted entry to receive
  notifications when that Pokémon is nearby.

\section{Grinding}
\label{sec:grinding}
For me, the joy of Pokémon GO is almost entirely found in its PvP League play (\autoref{sec:3x3}).
Others take pleasure from its collection and social aspects.
Either way, you'll be doing a good bit of slogging in order to find, develop,
  and evolve powerful Pokémon.
Those willing to spend money can speed the process up a bit, but there's
  no escaping the fundamental cycles of Catch, Appraise, Transfer and
  Catch, Appraise, Develop. 
I began playing on 2025-03-01.
As I write this about four months later, I have caught 20,364 Pokémon, of which
  I have retained 441---a little less than 2.2\%.

\subsection{Collecting Pokémon}
\label{subsec:getmons}
Pokémon can be received from other Trainers via trades (\autoref{sec:trades}),
  but most are captured with Pokéballs in encounters.
An encounter involves a single subject Pokémon, a single Trainer,
  and possibly that Trainer's current Buddy Pokémon.
Outcomes (aside from certain plot-based encounters) include capture, flight of
  the Pokémon, and departure of the Trainer.

During the initial tour with Professor Willow, you select one of
 Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, or Pikachu to catch.
You will enter the Encounter screen, be provided an infinite supply of
  Pokéballs for the encounter, and enjoy a catch rate (\autoref{sec:catch}) set to 100\%.

Pokémon will spawn on the Map screen, seemingly at random (see \autoref{sec:spawns} for details).
Pressing on them will open the Encounter screen with that Pokémon,
  providing an opportunity to catch it.
Encounters are also triggered by the completion of certain Research,
  defeats of Team GO Rocket, Raid wins, and Max Battle wins.
Encounters due to Research can be arbitrarily postponed by leaving the encounter screen,
  or simply not closing the research out.
Leaving wild encounters might see the Pokémon disappear from the Map, especially
  if you've moved significantly, or much time has gone by.
Encounters following battle wins are one-and-done; if you exit the encounter,
  that Pokémon is gone.

\subsection{Collecting XP}
\label{subsec:getxp}
Gaining sufficient XP advances the Trainer's level.
It is most regularly received for capturing Pokémon, but large awards are
  available by other means, and can be the source of a majority of a Trainer's XP.
  \textbf{FIXME}
Using a Lucky Egg doubles all XP awards for thirty minutes.
During this time, a timer appears on the upper right of the map screen.
Lucky Eggs can be bought from the Shop (one for 80 Pokécoins or eight for 500),
  and are sometimes awarded for completing Research.

\subsection{Collecting Stardust}
\label{subsec:getdust}
Trainers pay a cost (partially) in Stardust
  to level up their Pokémon (\autoref{sec:plevel}),
  to trade them (\autoref{sec:trades}),
  to purify Shadow Pokémon (\autoref{sec:shadow}),
  to teach them second charged attacks (\autoref{sec:charged}),
  to change certain forms (\autoref{sec:forms}),
  and to activate Adventure Effects (\autoref{sec:effects}).
Stardust becomes the primary bottleneck on advancement fairly early in the game:
  Pokémon at higher levels require more Stardust to power up (\autoref{table:powerups}),
  but the amount of Stardust awarded for their capture doesn't change.
There is never enough, and one must carefully manage its use.
\begin{table}[hb]

    \end{tabular}
  \end{centering}
  \caption{Stardust awards for capturing Pokémon}
  \label{table:stardust}
\end{table}

The primary means of acquiring Stardust is catching Pokémon.
The vast majority of Pokémon result in one of three awards based on their stage
 (\autoref{sec:evolution}), but a few offer more (\autoref{table:stardust}),
 making them excellent targets for Razz berries.
A Pokémon which is weather-boosted (\autoref{sec:weather}) awards 25\% more than normal.
Stardust can also be collected for wins in the GO Battle League,
  opening Gifts (\autoref{sec:gifts}),
  completing Routes,
  completing Research,
  participating in Showcases,
  defeating Team Leaders in Trainer Battles,
  defeating Team GO Rocket,
  hatching eggs,
  feeding berries to Pokémon defending your team's Gyms (30 per),
  and from weekly Adventure Sync rewards based on the total distance walked.
5🟉 and 6🟉 Max Battles award 15,000 and 25,000 Stardust respectively.

Using a Star Piece increases all Stardust awards by 50\% for thirty minutes.
During this time, a timer appears on the upper right of the map screen.
Star Pieces can be bought from the Shop (one for 100 Pokécoins or eight for 640),
  and are sometimes awarded for completing Research.

\subsection{Collecting Candy}
\label{subsec:getcandy}
Each genus (\autoref{sec:evolution}) has its own flavor of Candy and Candy XL.
Along with Stardust, most Pokémon enhancement is driven by Candy.
Candy is primarily acquired by capturing Pokémon: each capture (in any context)
  awards Candy (and possibly Candy XL) of the capture's genus.
Three Candy are awarded for capture of a Stage 1 Pokémon, five for a Stage 2,
  and ten for Stage 3.
Pinap and Silver pinap berries increase this award (\autoref{sec:berries}).

A Pokémon can be ``transferred to the Professor'' for soul harvesting;
  its loss of existence is your gain of one tasty Candy.
Certain plot armored Pokémon cannot be harvested (\autoref{sec:myths}).
Evolution consumes many Candies, but returns one when complete.

Candy XL is necessary for advancing Pokédex past Level 40.
100 Candy can be exchanged for a single Candy XL of that same flavor.
Each Rare Candy can be converted into a Candy of arbitrary flavor, and Rare Candy XL
  can likewise take on any flavor of Candy XL.

It is possible through Research to receive Candy for a genus not present in
  your Pokédex, i.e. one whose constituent species you have never captured.
You'll keep this Candy, but it doesn't result in a Pokédex entry.
Likewise, Candy is retained even if all Pokémon of that genus have been transferred.
\subsection{Collecting Energies}
The relevant Energies (Mega, Primal, Fusion, and Crown) can be acquired by winning a raid of that type,
  walking with a Mega Evolved or Primal Reverted Buddy, and completing
  certain research tasks.
\textbf{FIXME}

\subsection{Collecting Pokécoins (and F2P vs. P2P)}
\label{subsec:getcoins}
Pokémon GO is free to download, with optional microtransactions through the ingame
  Shop and the Pokémon GO web store.
Pokécoins can be used to purchase most items\footnote{Event passes generally require cash,
  as do some web store bundles.}, and local currency can purchase Pokécoins.
Interestingly, the ratio of exchange rates for Pokécoin and USD diverges
  wildly across regions.
It should be noted that use of e.g. a VPN to purchase Pokécoins remotely is a
  violation of the TOS.
A one-time award of 150 Pokécoins---a humble sum---is presented upon reaching Level 7,
  mainly to ensure Trainers are aware of the game's spending opportunities.
More usefully, Pokémon defeated while defending a Gym (\autoref{sec:gyms}) can
  return with Pokécoins.
The Pokémon receives one Pokécoin for every ten minutes spent in the Gym,
  and presents these weregild to the Trainer upon return.
The Trainer can collect only 50 Pokécoin each calendar day, no matter how many Pokémon return.
This maximum is achieved by eight hours' and twenty minutes' occupancy of Gyms.

As an example, a Trainer leaves Pokémon in aligned gyms at 2200h and 2210h local time.
The first returns at 2341h that evening, the second at 1001h the next morning.
The Trainer receives 10 Pokécoins at 2341h, and 50 Pokécoins at 1001h, for a total of 60.
If the first returned instead at 0001h, the Trainer would receive 12 Pokécoins at 0001h,
  and 38 Pokécoins at 1001h, for a total of 50.
Note that the second case earns less, despite greater occupancy time.
By regularly taking Gyms, with a little luck a Trainer can accumulate 350 Pokécoins each week
  without spending real money.

Is it possible to play PGO at a high level without spending money?
The serious collector-style Trainer has costs related to storage and raiding (\autoref{sec:raids})
  that can't be easily met by 350 Pokécoins per week, especially
  in pursuit of Shiny Pokémon (\autoref{sec:shiny}).
Millions of people collect at a hobbyist level without spending money.
For the PvP-oriented Trainer, there's little need to spend at all,
  especially if you live in an area with lots of PGO activity.
I have minimal Bag and Pokémon storage (800 and 500 respectively), and raid almost exclusively locally using the daily free pass.
Very few of my Pokémon have the optimal IVs for their Leagues (\autoref{chap:bounded}),
  and I don't yet have many Pokémon with which I'd like to experiment,
  yet my Great and Ultra League Elos rarely dip below 2300.
Frankly, I consider my free play a point of pride\footnote{I've spent a little less than 80 USD to date.}.
Whether one needs spend money in Pokémon GO is entirely a matter of goals, dedication, and patience.
With that said, if you want to spend, go with God, and all the better for you---thanks for making my free play possible.

The calculus changes for rural Trainers.
Without local raiding (and at least four or five other Trainers to join on larger battles),
  it will be difficult to collect a diverse team of competitive Pokémon.
There are two alternatives: trading (\autoref{sec:trades}), which requires meeting Trainers
  already in possession of the desired Pokémon, and remote raiding.
Remote raiding requires passes, which require Pokécoins---525 for 3 passes at this time.
Collecting the maximum 50 from Gyms eleven out of every fourteen days, you can do
  three free remote raids every two weeks.
Only you know whether that can satisfy your needs.
