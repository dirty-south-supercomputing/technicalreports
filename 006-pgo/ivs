Part I

Understanding IVs requires understanding the damage equation, central to all
combat in Pokémon GO. Each Pokémon has some non-negative integer number of hit
points. Every attack suffered reduces hit points by some positive integer
("damage"). Upon reaching zero, the Pokémon faints.

Damage is calculated (leaving aside some details [0]) by multiplying the
attack's power by type effects and the attacking Pokémon's "effective ATK",
and dividing this product by the attacked Pokémon's "effective DEF".
The result is truncated (rounded down to the largest integer not greater
than the input), and added to one.

Every Pokémon has two three-vectors:
* The base vector, common to all Pokémon of a given form. Three positive integers ranging into the hundreds.
* The individual vector, randomly generated for each Pokémon. Three non-negative integers not greater than 15.
   The three components of this vector are independently generated. The generation
   is uniformly distributed between a situation-specific floor and 15.
   This means that for e.g. a floor of twelve, the three values have no influence on one
    another, and the values {12, 13, 14, 15} are equally likely for each.
    A floor of zero allows 4,096 different IVs, all equally likely.

Each vector maps to ATK, DEF, and STA.
A vector sum yields a single three-vector, the "combined" ATK, DEF, and STA.
The Pokémon's level [1] determines a scalar, the Combat Power Multiplier.
These range from 0.094 to 0.8453, with higher levels having higher CPM.
Multiplication of the combined vector by the CPM yields the "effective" ATK, DEF, and STA
 used by the damage equation.
Until Part III, we will work with the combined vector with no loss of generality.

Every Greninja has a base vector of { 223, 152, 176 }.
Depending on the IV, a particular Greninja has a combined vector of { 223--238, 152--167, 176--191 }.
Every Venusaur has a base vector of { 198, 189, 190 }.
Depending on the IV, a particular Venusaur has a combined vector of { 198--213, 189--204, 190--205 }.
The IV cannot give Venusaur a combined ATK equal to any Greninja,
 and no Greninja can achieve a combined DEF rivaling any Venusaur.
A Greninja with an IV[STA] of fifteen does, however, beat out the combined STA of a Venusaur with
 IV[STA] of zero (191 vs 190).
The IV can be interpreted as a bonus: a Greninja can improve its ATK by up to 6.7%, its DEF by up to 9.9%,
 and its STA by up to 8.5% depending on its particular IV.
Alternatively (and more usefully), we can interpret it as a penalty: relative to an "optimal" Greninja having IV
 {15, 15, 15}, it can lose up to 6.3% of its ATK, 9.0% of its DEF, and 7.9% of its STA.
This second approach allows a more general sense of "optimal", which we'll need in Part III.

A higher base stat has less possible change due to IV as a percentage, but this can be misleading.
An IV[ATK] of 15 adds the same amount of power to a base ATK of 100 as it does to 1000:
This can be seen by distributing the damage numerator's multiplication across the two
 components of the combined stat.

 D = ((ATK + 15) * C) / DEF
   = (ATK * C + 15 * C) / DEF
   = ATK*C / DEF + 15*C / DEF

For DEF, things are different.
We cannot freely distribute, and a high IV[DEF] does indeed have more impact with a lower base DEF.
Let's see this with numbers.
Assign the defender a combined DEF of 50.
Assume an attacker with combined ATK of 100, then 1000:

> (115 / 50) - (100 / 50)   = 0.3
> (1015 / 50) - (1000 / 50) = 0.3

The increase from an IV[STA] of 15 is constant.
Now assign the attacker a combined ATK of 100.
Assume a defender with combined DEF of 20, then 50:

> (100 / 50) - (100 / 65) = 0.46
> (100 / 20) - (100 / 35) = 2.14

The lower base DEF benefits much more from the high IV.
This effect is more pronounced as combined ATK grows with respect to combined DEF.

So IVs are just as important---or unimportant---as base stats.
Holding everything else (especially attacks and typing) equal, a Pokémon with
  base stats { 100, 100, 100 } and IV { 15, 15, 15 } differs from some other
  Pokémon with base stats { 115, 115, 155 } and IV { 0, 0, 0 } only in appearance.
Paying more attention to IVs than base stats never makes sense.
A "garbage" Kyogre with an IV of { 10, 10, 10 } ought still kick the everloving shit
 out of any Greninja of the same level.
A hundo Delibird is only slightly less useless than any other Delibird; admire for a moment
 the many mysteries of nature, then transfer that bitch.

Alright, smoke 'em if you've got 'em.

Part II

These differences don't necessarily translate to observable results,
 due to the truncation operation.
Let's take Greninja's ATK range of 223--238, and have it attack a Venusaur with DEF 200 (a IV[DEF] of eleven).
Assume all multipliers to be unity (one).
The lowest ATK (223) results in 1.115, while the max (238) sees 1.19.
Truncation results in both of these quotients inflicting 2 points of damage.
If the multiplier is eight, the inputs to truncation are 8.92 and 9.52 (a difference of 0.6), for 9 vs 10 points of damage.
At a multiplier of nine, the difference in inputs is larger (10.035 and 10.71, a difference of 0.675), yet the
 damage is 11 either way.
Above a certain multiplier, we'll always see a difference, but it never becomes linear.

-----------------------------------------------------

Q: What are the base statistics?
A: Each Pokémon form has three stats, all non-negative integers: ATK, DEF, and STA.
E: Greninja is 223 ATK, 152 DEF, 176 STA.

Q: What is an IV?
A: A vector of three integers between 0 and 15, inclusive, particular to an individual Pokémon.
E: 15-15-15, 0-15-15, 12-8-4

Q: What is the significance of a Pokémon's IV?
A: The three components are added to the base stats, yielding the modified stats.
E: A Greninja with IV 12-8-4 has modified ATK 235 (223 + 12), DEF 160 (152 + 8), and STA 180 (176 + 4).

Q: What about the Pokémon's level?
A: Each level has an associated (ideal) Combat Power Multiplier, a positive rational. Level 1 is 0.094.
   Level 50 is 0.8453. This is multiplied by the modified stats, yielding the effective stats.
E: Our Greninja at level 48.5 has CPM of 0.8378, and thus \Eff{A} 196.883, \Eff{D} 134.048, and \Eff{S} 150.804.

Q: Who gives a shit?
A: Effective ATK and effective DEF form the core of the damage equation. STA determines MHP.

Q: How does \Eff{S} relate to MHP?
A: MHP is the floor of \Eff{S}, or 10, whichever is higher.

Q: Higher \Eff{S} always yields higher MHP.
A: False. Higher floor of \Eff{S} always yields higher MHP.
A: \Eff{S} of 175.5 and \Eff{S} of 175 both yield 175 MHP.

Q: So I want high IVs, right?
A: Unless operating under a CP bound---
Q: A CP bound?
A: Great League has a CP bound of 1500, and Ultra League a CP bound of 2500.
   This establishes a level bound, usually below 50, for each given form+IV.
   For the Master League, raids, Max Battles, and Team GO Rocket, higher
   effective stats are at least as good, and usually better, than lower ones.
   Increases in any of the inputs (base statistics, IVs, and level) are desirable.

Q: So how important are IVs in those scenarios?
A: They are no more or less important than the base statistics. All calculations affected by base stats or IVs
   use them indirectly via the modified stats. A Pokémon with a base ATK of 200 and an IV of 15-x-x has the exact same
   modified ATK as another Pokémon with a base ATK of 205 and an IV of 10-x-x.

Q: So how important are IVs?
A: They make up a portion of the total possible modified stat. For ATK, they can account for 46.9% (Shuckle, base ATK 17)
   to 3.5% of the potential (Deoxys Attack, base ATK 414). For DEF, they can account for 31.9% (Igglybuff, base DEF 32)
   to 3.6% of the potential (Shuckle, base DEF 396). For STA, they can account for 93.8% (Shedinja, base STA 1)
   to 2.9% of the potential (Blissey, base STA 496). When the base stat is 150 or more, a component can account for
   no more than 10% of the potential.

Q: Some Pokémon with \IV{A} of 15 will have the highest possible \Eff{A} of its species, even under a CP bound.
A: False. A higher level with a lower \IV{A} might result in a higher \Eff{A}, usually with a high (but not necessarily maximum) \IV{A}.
E: Deoxys Defense at 1500 maximizes \Eff{A} at 105.534 with \ivlev{14}{0}{0}{25}.

Q: Some Pokémon with \IV{D} of 15 will have the highest possible \Eff{D} of its species, even under a CP bound.
A: False. Same reasoning as above.
E: Feraligatr at 1499 maximizes \Eff{D} at 122.174 with \ivlev{0}{14}{0}{20.5}.

Q: The closer a Pokémon's CP is to the bound, the higher the arithmetic mean of the Pokémon.
A: False. The relationship of CP to arithmetic mean is complicated.
E: Greninja \ivlev{0}{10}{13}{21.5} yields 1497 at 118.49. Greninja \ivlev{3}{13}{14}{21} yields 1499 at 118.451.

Q: The closer a Pokémon's CP is to the bound, the higher the geometric mean of the Pokémon.
A: False. The relationship of CP to geometric mean is complicated.
E: Greninja \ivlev{1}{15}{15}{21} yields 1499 at 117.593. Greninja \ivlev{0}{9}{15}{21.5} yields 1500 at 117.576.

Q: Each Pokémon has a best IV for a given CP bound, or more generally, the possible IVs can be globally ordered.
A: False. Most functions for evaluating Pokémon will order different IVs different ways.

Q: A Shadow form has a better geometric mean than the normal form.
A: Shadow and normal forms have the same geometric mean.

Q: A Shadow form has a better arithmetic mean than the normal form.
A: False. With the same IVs, a Shadow form will have a higher arithmetic mean if \Eff{A} > 5/6*\Eff{D}.
   If \Eff{A} < 5/6*\Eff{D}, the Shadow form will have a lower arithmetic mean.
   If \Eff{A} = 5/6*\Eff{D}, the two forms will have equal arithmetic means.

Q: If a Shadow form exists, some Shadow will have the highest possible \Eff{A} of the species.
A: True.

Q: If a Shadow form exists, some Shadow will have the lowest possible \Eff{D} of the species.
A: True.

Q: Powering up from level N to N+1 adds the same amount of CP to all members of a family having the same IV.
A: False. It depends on the base stats.
E: Ivysaur gains 20 CP going from level 10 (401) to 10.5 (421).
   Venusaur gains 34 CP going from level 10 (669) to 10.5 (703).

Q: Powering up from a higher level adds less than or equal to the amount of CP as any lower level.
A: False. The floor function will have its due.
E: Venusaur gains 34 CP going from 24 (1606) to 24.5 (1640).
   Venusaur gains 33 CP going from 23.5 (1573) to 24 (1606).

Q: Given two IVs A and B at a given CP bound, if all components of A are greater than or equal to the corresponding members of B, the components of \Eff{A} cannot all be less than or equal to \Eff{B}.
A: False. STA can sometimes be traded to gain levels.
E: Glalie 15-15-15 at 24.5 has \Eff{A} 117.036, \Eff{D} 117.036, and 135 HP.
   Glalie 15-15-13 at 25 has \Eff{A} 118.224, \Eff{D} 118.224, and 135 HP.

Q: Is it generally more important to minimize \IV{A} or maximize \IV{D} and \IV{S}?
A: It is dependent on the base stats, but a higher \IV{A} can drive down all
   three effective stats (due to underleveling), while a lower \IV{D} or \IV{S}
   can only drive down their derived effective stat.
