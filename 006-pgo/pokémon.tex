\chapter{Pok√©mon\label{chap:pokemon}}
For purposes of battle\footnote{Attributes not directly relevant to battle include height, weight, region,
generation, Shiny status, Purified status, Lucky status, Legendary status, Mythological status, spawn
reason, capture method, capture location, and capture time.}, a Pok√©mon $P$\, is defined as having:
\begin{itemize}
\item A species and form (and thus a typing and base stats)
\item An Individual Vector (IV) (\autoref{sec:ivs}) and level (\autoref{sec:plevel})
\item A set of two or three attacks, one of which is a fast attack
\item Modifiers to attack and defense due charged attacks' stat effects (\autoref{sec:buffs})
\item Shadow status, or the absence thereof
\item Some number of hit points not exceeding \MHP
\end{itemize}
Hit Points are carried across PvE battles (including encounters with
  Team GO Rocket and Gym battles), but Trainer Battles always start with full \HP\@.
A Pok√©mon with zero hit points has ``fainted''.
Fainted Pok√©mon cannot be used in battles of any kind, nor can they be left in
 Power Stops (see \autoref{sec:maxbattles}).

\section{Pok√©mon Level\label{sec:plevel}}
Each Pok√©mon has its own level, taking one of the 99 integer and half-integer
 values between 0--50, inclusive.
A Trainer can ``power up'' their Pok√©mon in single level increments,
 not exceeding the Trainer's own level plus 10.
Each increase has a cost in Stardust and the Candy of that genus; beyond level 40, there
  is a further cost in Candy XL (\autoref{table:powerups}).

\end{tabular}
\caption{Power-up costs for Pok√©mon levels\label{table:powerups}}
\end{table}
An increase in level improves the Pok√©mon's attack and defense, and
  will sometimes increase \MHP\@.
See \autoref{sec:staticstats} for a quantitative treatment.

Powering up a fainted Pok√©mon will revive it, but with minimal \HP\@:
\[ \HP = \min{1, \MHP_\mathrm{New} - \MHP_\mathrm{Old} } \]
Advancing a normal Pok√©mon from level 1 to level 50 is not a cheap endeavor (\autoref{table:sumcosts}),
  though Shadow Pok√©mon of course have a minimum level of eight, purified Pok√©mon are always
  at least level 25, and most captures will be well above level 1.
Note that pushing level 40 to 50 requires more Stardust than going from 1 to 40.

\end{table}

\section{Individual Vectors\label{sec:ivs}}
Each Pok√©mon has three associated integers, each ranging from 0--15.
Once a Trainer has joined a team (\autoref{sec:levels}), the ``Appraise'' function can be used to
  get a visual representation of these three numbers (this representation,
  while annoying, is sufficient to determine the actual numbers).
Additionally, the Pok√©mon will be given a rating of 0--4 (\autoref{table:appraisal}), represented as
  zero, one, two, or three stars (4 shows three, albeit in a different color).
A Pok√©mon rated 4 has an IV of 15/15/15, and is colloquially known as a ``hundo'' or ``100\%er''.
Such Pok√©mon have their own Pok√©dex (\autoref{sec:dexen})\footnote{A Pok√©mon with an IV of 0/0/0
 is colloquially known as a ``nundo'' or ``0\%er''. They have no unique Pok√©dex, because they are worthless pieces of shit,
  and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Consult \autoref{chap:optimal} to see that 0/0/0 is never an optimal IV.}.
While 15/15/15 is generally the optimal IV, this is not always true in \CP-bounded
  competition; see \autoref{chap:bounded} for more information,
  and \autoref{chap:optimal} for tables of optimal IVs under different \CP{} bounds.
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Appraisal & Minimum sum of IVs\\
\Midrule
4üüâ & 45\\
3üüâ & 37\\
2üüâ & 30\\
1üüâ & 23\\
0üüâ & 0\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Appraisals for various IVs\label{table:appraisal}}
\end{table}

Three things can change a Pok√©mon's IV, which is otherwise constant across its existence.
Purification (\autoref{sec:shadow}) raises each component by two, not to exceed fifteen.
Trades (\autoref{sec:trades}) reroll the IV entirely.
Finally, Gold Bottle Caps allow a Pok√©mon of at least Best Buddy status (\autoref{sec:buddies}) 
  to enter ``hypertraining''.
The Trainer specifies a new, higher IV, and is assigned a set of Research-like tasks.
If they are completed within the specified time, the Pok√©mon acquires the new IV.
At the time of this writing, Gold Bottle Caps have been available only through paid Research.

\section{Generation of IV and level\label{sec:ivgeneration}}
IVs and levels are generated when the Pok√©mon is ``created'', not when it is captured.
It is thus possible to glean information from the \CP{} displayed for a Pok√©mon;
  one can sometimes even uniquely determine the IV\@.
The equation for \CP{} is provided in \autoref{chap:unbounded}; reverse it and
  use \autoref{table:cpm} plus the base stats of the species to determine
  the set of IV+level pairs yielding that \CP\@.
Various applications and websites can perform this analysis automatically.
Depending on the situation, there might be a floor for IVs.
Beyond that, they are uniformly randomly generated.
The chance of any given IV for a catch in the wild (without weather boosting)
  is exactly the same---1 out of 4096.
The probability of a random Pok√©mon being a hundo is actually
  greater than that of being a nundo, due to the existence of IV floors
  (e.g. the chance of a 15/15/15 for a lucky trade is 1 in 256, whereas
  a 0/0/0 is impossible).
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
Context & IV floors & Level \\
\Midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{Wild catch} & 0 & 1--max(TL, 30) \\
& 4 w/ weather boost & 1--max(TL, 30) + 5 \\

& 5 w/ Best Friend & \\
& 12 (lucky trade) & \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{IV and level floors for acquired Pok√©mon\label{table:ivfloors}}
\end{table}

\section{Lucky Pok√©mon\label{sec:lucky}}
Trades sometimes result in both Pok√©mon becoming ``Lucky''.
Lucky Pok√©mon have an IV floor of 12/12/12, and enjoy a 50\% discount on Stardust for power-ups
  (this does not extend to learning second charged attacks).
This discount stacks with the 10\% purification discount, so costs for
  powering up Lucky Purified Pok√©mon run 45\% of normal.

\section{Static stats\label{sec:staticstats}}
We'll define some statistics for each Pok√©mon.
These values are used as inputs to battle mechanics.
First, sum the Species's ATK, DEF, and STA with the Pok√©mon's
IVs to generate \Mod{A}, \Mod{D}, and \Mod{S}:
\begin{align*}
 \Mod{A} &= \mathit{ATK} + \mathit{\IV{A}} \\
 \Mod{D} &= \mathit{DEF} + \mathit{\IV{D}} \\
 \Mod{S} &= \mathit{STA} + \mathit{\IV{S}}
\end{align*}
These are typically scaled by the Pok√©mon's Combat Power Multiplier.
\section{Combat Power Multiplier\label{sec:cpm}}
Recall that each Pok√©mon has its own Level, ranging from 1.0
 to 50.0, defined on half integers\footnote{I would rather they
 simply be integer Levels 1--99, but this is settled terminology.}.
This Level is used as an index into a table of positive rational constants.
The value accessed is that Pok√©mon's Combat Power Multiplier (\CPM).
\CPM{} maxes out at Level 50 with a value of 0.8403, and takes its
  0.094 minimum at Level 1.
At Level 10, \CPM{} is 0.4225, almost half of its maximum value.
At Level 34, \CPM{} is 0.7557, about 90\% of its maximum value.
The extremal ratios are 0.1119 (L1 / L50) and 8.9394 (L50 / L1).

\end{table}

\section{Effective stats\label{sec:effectivestats}}
Multiplying $\mathit{Mod_S}$ by CPM yields $\mathit{Eff_S}$, which determines a Pok√©mon's Maximum Hit Points (MHP).
When a Pok√©mon's Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is knocked out, and cannot be
 used (nor made a Buddy) until revived.
Hit Points are persistent across Raids, Max Battles, and Team Rocket encounters,
 and can be restored (up to MHP) with Potions\footnote{Trainer Battles (other
 than those with Team Rocket) always start with full HP.}.
MHP is defined such that it is always an integer not less than ten:
\begin{align*}
 \mathit{Eff_S} &= \mathit{Mod_S} \cdot CPM \\
 MHP &= \min{10, \lfloor \mathit{Eff_S} \rfloor}
\end{align*}
Multiplying $Mod_S$ by CPM yields $Eff_{ARaw}$, used to determine charged move priority (\autoref{sec:3x3}).
$M_{Shadow}$ is $\frac{6}{5}$ if the Pok√©mon is a Shadow Pok√©mon, and 1 otherwise.
Multiplying $Eff_{ARaw}$ by $M_{Shadow}$ yields $Eff_A$.
Multiplying $Mod_D$ by CPM and dividing by $M_{Shadow}$ gives us $Eff_D$.
This manifests a 20\% bonus to $Eff_A$ and a 16.7\% penalty to $Eff_D$.
\begin{align*}
  Eff_{ARaw} &= Mod_A \cdot CPM\\
  Eff_A &= Eff_{ARaw} \cdot M_{Shadow} \\
 Eff_D &= \frac{Mod_D \cdot CPM}{M_{Shadow}}
\end{align*}
Is a Shadow Pok√©mon superior to its unshadowed equivalent, all else being equal?
Evaluating using a product function such as the geometric mean will show no difference;
 the two multipliers cancel one another.
\begin{align*}
  P &= Eff_A \cdot Eff_D\\
  &= \frac{6}{5}Mod_A \cdot \frac{5}{6}Mod_D \cdot CPM^2
\end{align*}
Using a sum function such as the arithmetic mean will usually show a difference.
When $Mod_A < \frac{5}{6}Mod_D$, the average goes down.
When $Mod_A = \frac{5}{6}Mod_D$, the average is unchanged,
 and the average increases if $Mod_A > \frac{5}{6}Mod_D$.

\section{Searching the Pok√©dex\label{sec:searching}}
The search interface for Pok√©dexen and storage is surprisingly capable.
Most strings are matched as substrings in both nicknames and species names,
 but there are a number of keywords (\autoref{table:searchterms}).
Most are self-evident.
Prefix a species with \texttt{+} to search for its genus.
Searching for a type will show any Pok√©mon with that type in their typing,
 \texttt{<type} matches Pok√©mon weak against \texttt{type},
 and \texttt{>type} those strong against it.
\texttt{x*} for \texttt{x} between 0 and 4 matches Pok√©mon with that appraisal.
\texttt{buddy0} matches Pok√©mon which have never been your Buddy,
 \texttt{buddy1} those made your Buddy but having earned zero hearts,
 and \texttt{buddyx} for \texttt{x} between 2 and 5 to match buddy
 levels \texttt{x} - 1.
\texttt{favorite} matches those marked ``favorite'' using a star system that
 seems like it could have handled in the general tagging system just fine
 but whatever.
Speaking of, \texttt{\#TAG} searches the tag space, and \texttt{\#} by itself
 matches anything tagged.
\texttt{@weather} shows Pok√©mon with at least one attack boosted by current
 weather, \texttt{@ATTACK} shows Pok√©mon who know \texttt{ATTACK}, and \texttt{@TYPE}
 any who know some attack of type \texttt{TYPE}.
Be more specific with \texttt{@xTYPE} for \texttt{x} between 1 and 3 to check
  for a fast, first charged, or second charged attack of the specified type.
Range suffixes take the form \texttt{NUM} for an exact match of \texttt{NUM},
  \texttt{NUMX-NUMY} for an inclusive match between \texttt{NUMX} and \texttt{NUMY},
  and \texttt{-NUM} for an inclusive ceiling.
\texttt{cpRANGE} and \texttt{hpRANGE} match Combat Power and hit points.
Use \texttt{distanceRANGE} and \texttt{ageRANGE} to match catch location
  distance in kilometers and catch age in days.
\texttt{yearRANGE} matches the catch year.
Union over searches is accomplished with the infix ';' operator (',' and ':' are synonyms),
  and intersection with '\&'\footnote{Oddly, '|' also seems to function as AND. I say ``oddly'' because it means OR everywhere else.
  Except the UNIX shell, where it means ``pipe''.
  And set theory (intensional comprehensions).
  And number theory (``divides'').
  And the bra-ket notation of quantum mechanics.
  OK, not everywhere, but that doesn't mean you use it for intersection.}.
It does not seem possible to search for regional forms using substrings,
 e.g.\ a search for ``alolan'' does not bring up my Alolan Exeggutor,
 but each region is itself a search keyword.

I nickname everything with a suffix indicating their IV's distance from the ideal.
If it's the ideal IV, the distance is zero.
