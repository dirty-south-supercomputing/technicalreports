\chapter{Pokémon}
\label{chap:pokemon}
For purposes of battle\footnote{Attributes not directly relevant to battle include size, weight, region,
generation, Shiny status, Purified status, Lucky status, Legendary status, Mythological status, spawn
reason, capture method, capture location, and capture time.}, a Pokémon $P$ is defined as having:
\begin{itemize}
\item A species and form (and thus a typing and base stats)
\item An Individual Vector (IV) (\autoref{sec:ivs}) and level (\autoref{sec:plevel})
\item A set of two or three attacks, one of which is a fast attack
\item Modifiers to attack and defense due charged attacks' stat effects (\autoref{sec:buffs})
\item Shadow status, or the absence thereof
\item Some number of hit points not exceeding MHP
\end{itemize}
Hit Points are carried across PvE battles (including encounters with
  Team GO Rocket and Gym battles), but Trainer Battles always start with full HP\@.
A Pokémon with zero hit points has ``fainted''.
Fainted Pokémon cannot be used in battles of any kind, nor can they be left in
 Power Stops (see \autoref{sec:maxbattles}).

\section{Pokémon Level}
\label{sec:plevel}
Each Pokémon has its own level, taking one of the 99 integer and half-integer
 values between 0--50, inclusive.
A Trainer can ``power up'' their Pokémon in single level increments,
 not exceeding the Trainer's own level plus 10.
Each increase has a cost in Stardust and the Candy of that genus; beyond level 40, there
  is a further cost in Candy XL (\autoref{table:powerups}).

\caption{Power-up costs for Pokémon levels}
\label{table:powerups}
\end{table}
An increase in level improves the Pokémon's attack and defense, and
  will sometimes increase MHP\@.
See \autoref{sec:staticstats} for a quantitative treatment.

Powering up a fainted Pokémon will revive it, but with minimal HP\@:
\[ HP = \min{1, MHP_{New} - MHP_{Old} } \]
Advancing a normal Pokémon from level 1 to level 50 is not a cheap endeavor (\autoref{table:sumcosts}),
  though Shadow Pokémon of course have a minimum level of eight, purified Pokémon are always
  at least level 25, and most captures will be well above level 1.
Note that pushing level 40 to 50 requires more Stardust than going from 1 to 40.

\section{Individual Vectors}
\label{sec:ivs}
Each Pokémon has three associated integers, each ranging from 0--15.
Once a Trainer has joined a team (\autoref{sec:levels}), the ``Appraise'' function can be used to
  get a visual representation of these three numbers (this representation,
  while annoying, is sufficient to determine the actual numbers).
Additionally, the Pokémon will be given a rating of 0--4, represented as
  one, two, or three stars (0 shows one star; 4 shows three, albeit in a different color).
A Pokémon rated 4 has an IV of 15/15/15, and is colloquially known as a ``hundo'' or ``100\%er''.
Such Pokémon have their own Pokédex (\autoref{sec:dexen}).
A Pokémon rated 0 has an IV of 0/0/0, and is colloquially known as a ``nundo'' or ``0\%er''.
They have no unique Pokédex, because they are worthless pieces of shit,
  and don't let anyone tell you otherwise\footnote{Consult \autoref{chap:optimal}
  to see that 0/0/0 is never an optimal IV.}.
While 15/15/15 is generally the optimal IV, this is not always true in CP-bounded
  competition; see \autoref{chap:bounded} for more information,
  and \autoref{chap:optimal} for tables of optimal IVs under different CP bounds.

%  \vspace{-\intextsep}
%  \includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{images/goldbottlecap.png}
%  \caption*{Golden Bottle Cap}
%\end{wrapfigure}
Three things can change a Pokémon's IV, which is otherwise constant across its existence.
Purification (\autoref{sec:shadow}) raises each component by two, not to exceed fifteen.
Trades (\autoref{sec:trades}) reroll the IV entirely.
Finally, Gold Bottle Caps allow a Pokémon of at least Best Buddy status (\autoref{sec:buddies}) 
  to enter ``hypertraining''.
The Trainer specifies a new, higher IV, and is assigned a set of Research-like tasks.
If they are completed within the specified time, the Pokémon acquires the new IV.
At the time of this writing, Gold Bottle Caps have been available only through paid Research.

\section{Generation of IV and level}
\label{sec:ivgeneration}
IVs and levels are generated when the Pokémon is ``created'', not when it is captured.
It is thus possible to glean information from the CP displayed for a Pokémon;
  one can sometimes even uniquely determine the IV\@.
The equation for CP is provided in \autoref{chap:unbounded}; reverse it and
  use \autoref{table:cpm} plus the base stats of the species to determine
  the set of IV+level pairs yielding that CP\@.
Various applications and websites can perform this analysis automatically.
Depending on the situation, there might be a floor for IVs.
Beyond that, they are uniformly randomly generated.
The chance of any given IV for a catch in the wild (without weather boosting)
  is exactly the same---1 out of 4096.
The probability of a random Pokémon being a hundo is actually
  greater than that of being a nundo, due to the existence of IV floors
  (e.g. the chance of a 15/15/15 for a lucky trade is 1 in 256, whereas
  a 0/0/0 is impossible).
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
Context & IV floors & Level \\
\Midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{Wild catch} & 0 & 1--max(TL, 30) \\
& 4 w/ weather boost & 1--max(TL, 30) + 5 \\

& 5 w/ Best Friend & \\
& 12 (lucky trade) & \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{IV and level floors for acquired Pokémon}
\label{table:ivfloors}
\end{table}

\section{Lucky Pokémon}
\label{sec:lucky}
Trades sometimes result in both Pokémon becoming ``Lucky''.
Lucky Pokémon have an IV floor of 12/12/12, and enjoy a 50\% discount on Stardust for power-ups
  (this does not extend to learning second charged attacks).
This discount stacks with the 10\% purification discount, so costs for
  powering up Lucky Purified Pokémon run 45\% of normal.

\section{Static stats}
\label{sec:staticstats}
We'll define some statistics for each Pokémon.
These values are used as inputs to battle mechanics.
First, sum the Species's ATK, DEF, and STA with the Pokémon's
 IVs to generate $Mod_A$, $Mod_D$, and $Mod_S$:
\begin{align*}
   Mod_A &= ATK + IV_A \\
   Mod_D &= DEF + IV_D \\
   Mod_S &= STA + IV_S
\end{align*}
These are typically scaled by the Pokémon's Combat Power Multiplier.
\section{Combat Power Multiplier}
\label{sec:cpm}
Recall that each Pokémon has its own Level, ranging from 1.0
 to 50.0, defined on half integers\footnote{I would rather they
 simply be integer Levels 1--99, but this is settled terminology.}.
This Level is used as an index into a table of positive rational constants.
The value accessed is that Pokémon's Combat Power Multiplier (CPM).
CPM maxes out at Level 50 with a value of 0.8403, and takes its 
  0.094 minimum at Level 1.
At Level 10, CPM is 0.4225, almost half of its maximum value.
At Level 34, CPM is 0.7557, about 90\% of its maximum value.
The extremal ratios are 0.1119 (L1 / L50) and 8.9394 (L50 / L1).

\end{tabular}
\caption{Combat Power Multiplier for Pokémon Levels}

\end{table}

\section{Effective stats}
\label{sec:effectivestats}
We multiply each of the $Mod$ values by the Pokémon's CPM to generate
 its $Eff_A$, $Eff_D$, and $Eff_S$.
$M_{Shadow}$ is $\frac{6}{5}$ if the Pokémon is a Shadow Pokémon,
  and 1 otherwise.
We multiply $Eff_A$ by this Shadow bonus, and divide $Eff_D$ by it.
This manifests a 20\% bonus to $Eff_A$ and a 16.7\% penalty to $Eff_D$.
$M_{ASE}$ and $M_{DSE}$ are the Pokémon's attack and defense multipliers due any active stat effect (\autoref{sec:buffs}).
Recall that the stat effect levels take the values -4--4, inclusive.
They are multiplied into $Eff_A$ and $Eff_D$ in 3x3 battle contexts (\autoref{sec:3x3})
  according to \autoref{table:buffs}.
\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{rll}
    Level & Multiplier & Comment \\
    \Midrule
    -4 & $0.5$ (-50\%) & \\
    -3 & $\frac{4}{7} ≈ 0.5715$ (-42.85\%) & ``Severely fell!'' \\
    -2 & $0.\overline{6}$ (-33.\textoverline{3}\%) & ``Harshly fell!'' \\
    -1 & $0.8$ (-20\%) & ``Fell!'' \\
     0 & $1$ & \\
     1 & $1.25$ (25\%) & ``Rose!'' \\
     2 & $1.5$ (50\%) & ``Rose sharply!''\\
     3 & $1.75$ (75\%) & ``Rose drastically!'' \\
     4 & $2$ (100\%) & \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Mapping buff/nerf stages to effect}
  \label{table:buffs}
\end{table}
The system behind the scheme of \autoref{table:buffs} is that the negative levels $-n$
 correspond to $\frac{4}{4 - n}$ while the positive levels $n$ correspond to
 $\frac{4 + n}{4}$.
\begin{align*}
 Eff_A &= Mod_A \times CPM \times M_{Shadow} \\
 Eff_D &= \frac{Mod_D \times CPM}{M_{Shadow}}
\end{align*}
$Eff_S$ determines the Pokémon's Maximum Hit Points (MHP).
When a Pokémon's Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is knocked out, and cannot be
 used (nor made a Buddy) until revived.
Hit Points are persistent across Raids, Max Battles, and Team Rocket encounters,
 and can be restored (up to MHP) with Potions\footnote{Trainer Battles (other
 than those with Team Rocket) always start with full HP.}.
MHP is defined such that it is always a positive integer:
\begin{align*}
 Eff_S &= Mod_S \times CPM \\
 MHP &= \min{1, \lfloor Eff_S \rfloor}
\end{align*}

\section{Searching the Pokédex}
\label{sec:searching}
The search interface for Pokédexen and storage is surprisingly capable.
Most strings are matched as substrings in both nicknames and species names,
 but there are a number of keywords (\autoref{table:searchterms}).
Most are self-evident: \texttt{lucky}, \texttt{shiny}, \texttt{traded}, \texttt{purified},
  \texttt{shadow}, \texttt{mythical}, and \texttt{legendary} do exactly
  what you'd think.
Identify Pokémon in gyms with \texttt{defender}.
\texttt{hatched} matches Pokémon originally hatched from eggs,
 and \texttt{eggsonly} those Pokémon that can only be found
 as hatchlings.
Costumed Pokémon from special events are matched by \texttt{costume}.
Searching for a type will show any Pokémon with that type in their typing.
\texttt{x*} for \texttt{x} between 0 and 4 matches Pokémon with that appraisal.
\texttt{favorite} matches those marked ``favorite'' using a star system that
 seems like it could have handled in the general tagging system just fine
 but whatever.
Speaking of, \texttt{\#TAG} searches the tag space.
Several terms cover evolutions: \texttt{evolvenew} for evolutions that will
  fill a Pokédex entry, \texttt{item} for evolutions that require an item,
  \texttt{tradeevolve} for Pokémon with the trade discount on evolution,
  and \texttt{evolve} for Pokémon whose evolution criteria are met.
\texttt{@weather} shows Pokémon with at least one attack boosted by current
 weather, \texttt{@ATTACK} shows Pokémon who know \texttt{ATTACK}, and \texttt{@TYPE}
 any who know some attack of type \texttt{TYPE}.
Be more specific with \texttt{@xTYPE} for \texttt{x} between 1 and 3 to check
  for a fast, first charged, or second charged attack of the specified type.
\texttt{cpNUM} and \texttt{hpNUM} match exactly \texttt{NUM} CP and HP\footnote{Niantic's claim
  that these can be suffixed with '-' to do a ceiling match seems false.};
  \texttt{cpNUM-NUM} and \texttt{hpNUM-NUM} provide range support.
Union over searches is accomplished with the infix ';' operator,
 and intersection with '\&'\footnote{Oddly, '|' also seems to function as AND.}.
It does not seem possible to search for regional forms using substrings,
 e.g.\ a search for ``alolan'' does not bring up my Alolan Exeggutor.
