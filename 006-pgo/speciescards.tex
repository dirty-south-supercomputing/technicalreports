\chapter{Species by typings\label{chap:speciesbytype}}
Forms are sorted by typing, and within typing by Pokédex number.
Historically, base statistics are rarely manipulated from season to season, but
 various Pokémon gain the ability to learn new attacks.

\begin{center}\textbf{Interpreting form cards}\end{center}

The title displays the form name on the left.
The shiny icon (\calign{\includegraphics[height=1em,keepaspectratio]{images/shiny.png}}) appears
 if a Shiny form has been released.
Either way, weather boost icons follow.
The form's base ATK, DEF, and STA appear on the right, followed by the arithmetic and geometric means
 ($\frac{BS}{3}$ and $\sqrt[3]{\BP\,}$).
The colors of the title bar indicate the typing.
To the right of a picture is a table of fast and charged attacks.
STAB is factored into applicable attacks (italics indicate a lack of STAB).
Fast attacks show turns, power, energy generated, \PPT{}, and \EPT{}\@.
Charged attacks show power, energy consumed, PPE, and any buffs.
Attacks in boldface cannot be acquired without an Elite TM or special circumstances.
Typing is indicated with icons.
The optimal configurations for \CP2500 and \CP1500-bounded play are specified below the attack table.
The last line of the card shows the Stardust bounty, cost group, generation, and region on the left,
 and evolutionary line on the right.
Finally, if there is a Shadow form, that is indicated, along with the same stats
  provided for the regular form.

\bigskip\noindent{}We see here that OV-099 Challenger has Ghost+Flying typing, with base ATK, DEF, and STA
of 200, 120, and 100, respectively. Its $\frac{BS}{3}$ is 140, and its $\sqrt[3]{\BP\,}$ is 133.89.
It has both a Shiny and a Shadow form. The Shadow form has higher ATK and lower DEF, changing
its $\frac{BS}{3}$ to 146.67. Its optimal configuration for a \CP1500 bound is 0/15/15 at level 37.5.
It is poorly suited for \CP2500 bounds and liftoffs in low temperatures.
Capturing a Challenger rewards 100 Stardust.

\chapter{Users of attacks\label{chap:attackemployers}}
It is often useful to build a team around attacks, rather than Pokémon.
This appendix lists the Pokémon which can learn and use a given attack.
Pokémon in italics will \textit{not} have STAB with the attack.
Pokémon in boldface require an Elite TM (or special circumstances) to acquire the move.
Attack cards display Nx1 stats in the middle of the title, and 3x3 stats on the right.
Stats are not infrequently tweaked between seasons.
