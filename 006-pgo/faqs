Q: What are the base statistics?
A: Each Pokémon form has three stats, all non-negative integers: ATK, DEF, and STA.
E: Greninja is 223 ATK, 152 DEF, 176 STA.

Q: What is an IV?
A: A vector of three integers between 0 and 15, inclusive, particular to an individual Pokémon.
E: 15-15-15, 0-15-15, 12-8-4

Q: What is the significance of a Pokémon's IV?
A: The three components are added to the base stats, yielding the modified stats.
E: A Greninja with IV 12-8-4 has modified ATK 235 (223 + 12), DEF 160 (152 + 8), and STA 180 (176 + 4).

Q: What about the Pokémon's level?
A: Each level has an associated (ideal) Combat Power Multiplier, a positive rational. Level 1 is 0.094.
   Level 50 is 0.8453. This is multiplied by the modified stats, yielding the effective stats.
E: Our Greninja at level 48.5 has CPM of 0.8378, and thus \Eff{A} 196.883, \Eff{D} 134.048, and \Eff{S} 150.804.

Q: Who gives a shit?
A: Effective ATK and effective DEF form the core of the damage equation. STA determines MHP.

Q: How does \Eff{S} relate to MHP?
A: MHP is the floor of \Eff{S}, or 10, whichever is higher.

Q: Higher \Eff{S} always yields higher MHP.
A: False. Higher floor of \Eff{S} always yields higher MHP.
A: \Eff{S} of 175.5 and \Eff{S} of 175 both yield 175 MHP.

Q: So I want high IVs, right?
A: Unless operating under a CP bound---
Q: A CP bound?
A: Great League has a CP bound of 1500, and Ultra League a CP bound of 2500.
   This establishes a level bound, usually below 50, for each given form+IV.
   For the Master League, raids, Max Battles, and Team GO Rocket, higher
   effective stats are at least as good, and usually better, than lower ones.
   Increases in any of the inputs (base statistics, IVs, and level) are desirable.

Q: So how important are IVs in those scenarios?
A: They are no more or less important than the base statistics. All calculations affected by base stats or IVs
   use them indirectly via the modified stats. A Pokémon with a base ATK of 200 and an IV of 15-x-x has the exact same
   modified ATK as another Pokémon with a base ATK of 205 and an IV of 10-x-x.

Q: So how important are IVs?
A: They make up a portion of the total possible modified stat. For ATK, they can account for 46.9% (Shuckle, base ATK 17)
   to 3.5% of the potential (Deoxys Attack, base ATK 414). For DEF, they can account for 31.9% (Igglybuff, base DEF 32)
   to 3.6% of the potential (Shuckle, base DEF 396). For STA, they can account for 93.8% (Shedinja, base STA 1)
   to 2.9% of the potential (Blissey, base STA 496). When the base stat is 150 or more, a component can account for
   no more than 10% of the potential.

Q: Some Pokémon with \IV{A} of 15 will have the highest possible \Eff{A} of its species, even under a CP bound.
A: False. A higher level with a lower \IV{A} might result in a higher \Eff{A}, usually with a high (but not necessarily maximum) \IV{A}.
E: Deoxys Defense at 1500 maximizes \Eff{A} at 105.534 with \ivlev{14}{0}{0}{25}.

Q: Some Pokémon with \IV{D} of 15 will have the highest possible \Eff{D} of its species, even under a CP bound.
A: False. Same reasoning as above.
E: Feraligatr at 1499 maximizes \Eff{D} at 122.174 with \ivlev{0}{14}{0}{20.5}.

Q: The closer a Pokémon's CP is to the bound, the higher the arithmetic mean of the Pokémon.
A: False. The relationship of CP to arithmetic mean is complicated.
E: Greninja \ivlev{0}{10}{13}{21.5} yields 1497 at 118.49. Greninja \ivlev{3}{13}{14}{21} yields 1499 at 118.451.

Q: The closer a Pokémon's CP is to the bound, the higher the geometric mean of the Pokémon.
A: False. The relationship of CP to geometric mean is complicated.
E: Greninja \ivlev{1}{15}{15}{21} yields 1499 at 117.593. Greninja \ivlev{0}{9}{15}{21.5} yields 1500 at 117.576.

Q: Each Pokémon has a best IV for a given CP bound, or more generally, the possible IVs can be globally ordered.
A: False. Most functions for evaluating Pokémon will order different IVs different ways.

Q: A Shadow form has a better geometric mean than the normal form.
A: Shadow and normal forms have the same geometric mean.

Q: A Shadow form has a better arithmetic mean than the normal form.
A: False. With the same IVs, a Shadow form will have a higher arithmetic mean if \Eff{A} > 5/6*\Eff{D}.
   If \Eff{A} < 5/6*\Eff{D}, the Shadow form will have a lower arithmetic mean.
   If \Eff{A} = 5/6*\Eff{D}, the two forms will have equal arithmetic means.

Q: If a Shadow form exists, some Shadow will have the highest possible \Eff{A} of the species.
A: True.

Q: If a Shadow form exists, some Shadow will have the lowest possible \Eff{D} of the species.
A: True.

Q: Powering up from level N to N+1 adds the same amount of CP to all members of a family having the same IV.
A: False. It depends on the base stats.
E: Ivysaur gains 20 CP going from level 10 (401) to 10.5 (421).
   Venusaur gains 34 CP going from level 10 (669) to 10.5 (703).

Q: Powering up from a higher level adds less than or equal to the amount of CP as any lower level.
A: False. The floor function will have its due.
E: Venusaur gains 34 CP going from 24 (1606) to 24.5 (1640).
   Venusaur gains 33 CP going from 23.5 (1573) to 24 (1606).

Q: Given two IVs A and B at a given CP bound, if all components of A are greater than or equal to the corresponding members of B, the components of \Eff{A} cannot all be less than or equal to \Eff{B}.
A: False. STA can sometimes be traded to gain levels.
E: Glalie 15-15-15 at 24.5 has \Eff{A} 117.036, \Eff{D} 117.036, and 135 HP.
   Glalie 15-15-13 at 25 has \Eff{A} 118.224, \Eff{D} 118.224, and 135 HP.
