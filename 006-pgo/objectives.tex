\chapter{Objectives\label{sec:goal}}
The goal of Pokémon GO is to consume time and divert one's attentions,
  ideally triggering regular releases of dopamine in your ratlike brain.
A secondary objective is stunting on webfora adolescents, but one

Eventually most of the matmuls for which you are responsible will be performed in a data center.
You'll receive UBI, perhaps, I guess, for some reason, or simply be transferred to the Professor.

stepping down into the darkness before the footlamps, destined for a night that is
eternal and without name.\\

  thing about life itself.\\
