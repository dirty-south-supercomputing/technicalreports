I was tasked with designing and implementing a persistent associative array
mapping names to arbitrary data\footnote{I.e. a single-directory filesystem, often called a \textit{blobstore}.}
using the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 and two Winbond W25N01GV gigabit SLC
NAND chips, along with necessary drivers. The requirements permitted 4KB of RAM,
allowed no use of other persistent storage, and mandated a fully asynchronous
API running on ``bare metal'' (no OS, realtime or otherwise). I detail my
resulting design, and demonstrate its generally performant and robust
fulfillment of these specs. I also describe its pathological worst case
behaviors.
